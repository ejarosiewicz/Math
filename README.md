# Math

A set of two libraries: Numerical Integrations and Numerical Integrations Draw written for the purposes of my diploma thesis named: "Creating complex applications for tablets with Android system". A Numerical Integration java library is destined for counting defined integrations both square and trapeze methods from parsed function. A Numerical Integrations Draw is extension of previous library, which provides custom view with both function and selected integration's method graph. An application "Math" is demo of usage both libraries.

Now I'm working at refactoring, because project was written in a short period of time, and it contains some bugs and unclear parts of code. See "code-refactoring" branch for result. API documentation will be provided after end of the refactoring.
